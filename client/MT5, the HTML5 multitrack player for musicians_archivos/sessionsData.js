      'Recorded direct into the iTrack Solo, the guitar via the iTrack Solo’s instrument input sounds clean and alive, and forms a great foundation for the recording.',

Needless to say, drums have exceptional dynamic range, and the Scarlett pre captures it perfectly. Listen how the Coles ribbon room mics add life and space to the overall sound.',
      'Fender. Connected straight to the instrument input of the Scarlett. Listen to the cleanness of the bass sound and how the attacks are recorded flawlessly by the Scarlett instrument input, which shares much of the circuitry of the mic pre.',
      'Fender Hot Rod DeVille. Various floor pedals used. Amp was miked using a Shure SM57. This guitar provides an ethereal atmosphere with subtle attacks and long sustains, capturing clearly and accurately by the Scarlett pre.',
      'Fender Hot Rod DeVille. Various floor pedals used. Amp was miked using a Shure SM57. This guitar features extensive effects and provides added dimension to the track, demanding a surprising amount from the preamp.',
      'Fender Hot Rod DeVille. Various floor pedals used. Amp was miked using a Shure SM57. This guitar part underlies much of the song and includes both wide frequency range and dynamics. Listen to the attacks especially on chords and hear how Scarlett handles them.',
      'Fender Hot Rod DeVille. Various floor pedals used. Amp was miked using a Shure SM57. The sound is clear and clean: listen to the attack on the higher notes in particular and the sustain with tremolo.',
      'Neumann U87. This widely-used classic condenser microphone is perfect for the complex sound of the harmonica, the Scarlett pre capturing the range and depth of its sound.',
      'All vocal parts performed by ESKA using a Neumann U87. The U87 is a classic condenser mic and suits vocals particularly well. Scarlett provides the phantom power it needs and delivers excellent results.',

Needless to say, drums have exceptional dynamic range, and the Clarett pre captures it perfectly. Though it’s not practical to discern individual microphone contributions in a multi-mic drum track, the Coles ribbon room mics add life and space to the overall sound, while the overheads are enhanced by the ‘Air’ effect.',
      'Fender, with various floor pedals. The bass signal was recorded in 3 ways. We fed the bass into a DI split. This was then fed through the pedal board and into the Clarett. The clean DI signal was recorded. We also fed the bass signal out to an Ampeg B-15 which was then miked and recorded. The combination gives a rich, raw dirty sound that is captured superbly by the Clarett.',
      'Fender Stratocaster into a Marshall Cabinet and WEM Amp. Various floor pedals and effects; Shure SM57 was used to mic the cabinet. A quality dynamic mic on a guitar cabinet gives excellent results. Hear the Clarett capturing all the nuances of the performance with all its energy, frequency range and dynamics.',
      'Direct into the Clarett, demonstrating the quality of the Clarett line input capturing a fairly dirty electric piano sound.',
      'Recorded with a Neumann U87 and a pop shield; ‘Air’ mode was used on the Clarett. ‘Air’ mode is ideal for vocals as it opens the sound out and brings it to life.',
      'Recorded with a Neumann U87 and a pop shield; ‘Air’ mode was used on the Clarett. Listen to the openness and life of the sound on the male lead vocal here, particularly on sibilants.',
      'Recorded with a Neumann U87 and a pop shield; ‘Air’ mode was used on the Clarett. The ‘Air’ effect really suits the female lead vocal here, bringing out all the character of the performance.'

      'SM57 on bongos here; condenser mic overheads.',
      'Direct inject – the RedNet MP8R inputs accept both microphone and line levels. The part features a flanged electric piano-type sound that adds weight to the sound as the song develops.',
      '6 first violins, 6 seconds, 4 violas, 3 cellos, 1 double bass: DPA 4099 miniature condenser mics on each instrument with mounting clip; cellos and double bass also fitted with pickups; a stereo pair of Sennheiser 416s for ambience. Inevitably there is some leakage. Listen to the inner movement in the string section and the high violin passages.',
      '2 trumpets, 2 trombones, 1 bass trombone, 2 French horns, flute: Condenser clip mics on most instruments. Consisting primarily of held chords that swell in and out, the section is carefully balanced for a smooth, well-rounded sound.',
      'Picked up with eight Shure SM58s on tall stands. The choir comes in towards the end of the song, backing up selected vocal lines.',
      'A pair of condenser mics on tall stands. These are used to capture hall atmosphere and audience reaction towards the end of the song.',
      'Shure SM58. There’s inevitably some drum leakage, but in particular listen to the life and openness of Espa’s vocal, and its powerful edge.'

      'Jake Lipiec is playing an authentic 1970s Gretsch kit (in black). The sound of the kit includes a Neumann U47 for room sound - contributing to the open, live sound of the drums as a whole, especially the toms - and a pair of SE Voodoo VR2 ribbon mics for overheads. Check out the tight sound of the bass (kick) drum (miked with AKG D12 and U47 fet), and the snare sound (Shure SM57 top and bottom) on the Motown-style fills. Beyer M160 on hi-hat, toms miked with Sennheiser 421 top and bottom wired out of phase, and a Shure SM58 on smash cymbal.',
      'Mikey Jones is playing a Musicman Stingray into an Ampeg Portaflex B15N bass combo, miked with a U47 fet and plugged into one of the Red 4Pre mic preamps. It&#39s a very clean, tight sound with excellent attack and tone, highlighting the transparency of the &#39Red Evolution&#39 mic pre in the Red 4Pre.',
      'Jalen plays a Fender Telecaster through a classic Vox AC-30 CC2X 2x12 Combo, miked with an SM57 and a Neumann U87. In keeping with the track as a whole, the sound is clean and open - an ideal application for the Red 4Pre. Listen out for the touch of reverb highlighting the attacks.',
      'Overdubbed tambourine, sparse and distant and on key accents only, but adding an extra subtlety to the mix.',
      'Recorded with a Neumann U47 - ideal for vocals - the &#39Air&#39 effect on the Red 4Pre really brings out Jalen&#39s natural, open vocal style here, set off nicely by the reverb. Impressive light and shade throughout.',
      'Once again, the U47 is the perfect mic choice here, enhanced by the &#39Air&#39 effect on the Red 4Pre. A simple, single harmony line with significant reverb  most of the time but with nice tight 2-part "ooohs" in the bridge.'
